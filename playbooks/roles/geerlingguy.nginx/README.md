# Ansible Role: Nginx

Installs Nginx on RedHat/CentOS linux servers.

This role installs and configures the latest version of Nginx direct from the Nginx yum repository. You will likely need to do extra setup work after this role has installed Nginx, like adding your own [virtualhost].conf file inside `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`, describing the location and options to use for your particular website.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `vars/main.yml`):

    nginx_user: "nginx"

The user under which Nginx will run.

    nginx_worker_processes: "1"
    nginx_worker_connections: "1024"

`nginx_worker_processes` should be set to the number of cores present on your machine. Connections (find this number with `grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l`). `nginx_worker_connections` is the number of connections per process. Set this higher to handle more simultaneous connections (and remember that a connection will be used for as long as the keepalive timeout duration for every client!).

    nginx_client_max_body_size: "64m"

This value determines the largest file upload possible, as uploads are passed through Nginx before hitting a backend like `php-fpm`. If you get an error like `client intended to send too large body`, it means this value is set too low.

    nginx_keepalive_timeout: "65"

The keepalive timeout. Should be set higher (10s+) if you have more polling-style traffic (AJAX-powered sites especially), or lower (<10s) if you have a site where most users visit a few pages and don't send any further requests.

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: server
      roles:
        - { role: geerlingguy.nginx }

## TODO

  - Make this role work with all flavors of linux (as supported by nginx repos).
